# Twitter-Scraping-with-Streamlit-Web-Application

## Problem Statement: 
Currently, data is dispersed throughout the entire planet. There may be a large amount of data on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Twitter, and other social media platforms. This includes images and videos on YouTube and Instagram as opposed to Facebook and Twitter. To uncover the genuine factual information on Twitter, we must scrape the data and then scrutinize the additional insight. In this project, I scraped data from Twitter such as (date, id, url, tweet text, user, reply count, retweet count, language, source, like count, and so on).
